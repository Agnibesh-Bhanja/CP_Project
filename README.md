We created a Cloth Storage Management System using Python for backend logic and Streamlit for the user interface. The project includes the following features:

**Add New Item:** Add new items to the inventory with details like item name, price, and available units.

**Add to Cart:** Allow customers to add items to their cart by item ID.

**View Inventory:** Display all inventory items with details.

**Place Order:** Calculate the total cost for selected items, update inventory by reducing sold units, and finalize the order.

**Sort by Price:** Sort inventory items by price for better visibility.

**Top-Seller Display:** Identify and display the most frequently sold item.

**_This project was an enriching experience, combining coding logic with an intuitive GUI. Grateful for the journey and the learning! ðŸŽ‰_**
